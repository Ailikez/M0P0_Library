# Libraries

## Description
EDI's operating systems rely on these libraries to work. For example projects to compile, place the M0P0_Library folder on the same level with the other repos.
The folder tree should look as follows:
- Main Folder
  - M0P0_Library
  - M5P1_MuProkaron
  - M7M1_MuEukaron
  - M7M2_MuAmmonite
